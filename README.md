# 2024 Intelligent Embedded System Design Contest at ICMC



嵌入式人工智能系统设计大赛是ICMC举办的一项具有挑战性的的研发竞赛，侧重于解决现实世界中需要在龙芯开发板上实现机器学习算法的问题。该比赛向全球各地的团队开放。排名前三的团队将被邀请参加[第一届IEEE国际元计算大会（IEEE ICMC）](http://meta-computing.info/)展示他们的解决方案并颁发奖项。

Intelligent Embedded System Design Contest at ICMC is a challenging, research and development competition, focusing on real-world problems that requires the implementation of machine learning algorithms on Loongson development board. It is open to multi-person teams world-wide. The top three teams will be invited to [the 1st IEEE International Conference on Meta Computing (IEEE ICMC)](http://meta-computing.info/) to present their solutions, and to receive their awards.
